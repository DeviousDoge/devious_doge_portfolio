## Description

First public draft of my professional portfolio. This is my first real website I have built from the ground up and while simple and somewhat silly I like how it turned out. Website was built to vaguely resemble a specific template as instructed. Certain contents were modified to various degrees for functional and aesthetic reasons. Pictured below was the targeted template:

## Desktop
 ![desktop](assets/images/05-desktop.png "Desktop")

## Tablet
![tablet](assets/images/03-tablet.png "Tablet")

## Mobile
![mobile](assets/images/04-mobile.png "Mobile")


Upon building and designing this webpage I learned a great deal about more advanced concepts of CSS properties, but also learned more about concepts like font-families and color palletes. I learned how to troubleshoot and debug accounting for different devices from the comfort of google chrome, and I think I have built up a solid knowledge basis the fundamentals of web design in preperation for more advanced web development skillsets.
